I want to write a few words about the goals and objectives of this notebook..Â¶
of Course, the main goal is to achieve the maximum result in this competition, but not only.. I started my DS / ML career not so long ago and a lot of questions arise in the course of my work. In this notebook, I will try to give answers to the questions of beginners that I think they can ask, or that I myself would have asked at the very beginning.. So.. the result of this work will be submission. but let's understand in order what is needed for this I would conditionally split the whole process into 6 parts:

Carefully read the terms of the contest!!! It is important to understand what needs to be done, and most importantly how it will be evaluated!

Upload the submitted data: carefully study it, check for completeness and validity. You should understand the meaning of this data. If it is not clear, then look for an opportunity to solve this problem-search on the Internet, ask the organizers, ask your colleagues on kaggle. The point is that it is not possible to build a good model if you do not understand the logic of the process or the purpose of certain data.

Processing and preparing data: You need to study the data very carefully, select the fields that you intend to use in the model, and get rid of those that you don't think you need (you can always play this back). Put the data itself in order-delete or fill in the missing values, bring everything to the same view. All categorical data must be converted to a numeric form - for example, we have A, B, C-it must be 0,1,2 or 1,2,3, or male/female turns into 1/2.. and so on.

Identifying features: then the creative process begins:) next, we will consider how you can get a valuable feature from information that would seem completely useless at first glance.

there Is a set of features for the first run, you can start..

Debugging and calibrating models - another one creative process:)) although it is more formalized and automated than the selection of features:)

I also want to say right away that you will not find in this work a mega super cool model that gives 100500% accuracy. Maximum, I managed to get 0.80861, and it was just once. And so it gives an average of 0.795-0.805 if you play around with the settings.
